CPhos utilizes an information theory-based algorithm to assess the conservation and functional significance of phosphorylation sites among species. For more details, please refer to the publication and the website at http://helixweb.nih.gov/CPhos/

CPhos relies on several external programs: MUSCLE for sequence alignment, ClustalX for sequence alignment visualization, and NJplot for phylogenetic tree visualization. The citations for these programs are included below:
